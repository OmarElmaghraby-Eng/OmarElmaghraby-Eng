👋 Hi, I’m Omar Elmaghraby
I’m a junior high school student with a strong passion for Mechatronics, Electronics, Robotics, and Artificial Intelligence. I’m deeply fascinated by how machines can sense, think, and act — and I love exploring the engineering behind intelligent systems.

I’m especially enthusiastic about automation, robotics, and building machinery that can operate intelligently and independently. Whether it’s writing code, designing circuits, or understanding mechanical systems, I enjoy every part of the engineering process.

🎓 Education Path
I will be graduating high school in June 2027, and I plan to continue my studies in engineering at the University of New South Wales (UNSW). My goal is to specialize in fields that combine hardware, software, and intelligent automation.

🧠 Technical Skills
Programming Languages
Python — my main language for AI, automation, and problem‑solving

C — foundational understanding of low‑level logic and embedded systems

C++ — performance‑focused programming for robotics and control systems

Engineering Interests
Mechatronics & system integration

Robotics design, control, and automation

Electronics, circuits, and embedded hardware

Machine learning & intelligent algorithms

Sensors, actuators, and real‑world interfacing

Autonomous systems and smart machinery

Currently Learning
Machine learning fundamentals

Microcontroller programming (Arduino, ESP, etc.)

Robotics algorithms & control theory

Data structures and algorithms

How AI can enhance mechanical and electronic systems

🤖 Why Robotics & AI Inspire Me
Robots that can learn. Machines that can adapt. Systems that can operate on their own.

This intersection of mechanics + electronics + intelligence is what excites me the most. I love the idea of creating machines that don’t just move — but understand, react, and improve.

Automation is the future, and I want to be part of building it.

🚀 My Goals
Build advanced robotics and automation projects

Strengthen my engineering fundamentals before university

Contribute to open‑source AI and robotics communities

Develop intelligent systems that solve real‑world problems

Become a leading engineer in robotics, automation, and AI

🌟 What Drives Me
Curiosity. Creativity. A desire to build things that matter.

I’m constantly exploring new technologies, experimenting with ideas, and pushing myself to understand how intelligent machines work. Every project I take on brings me one step closer to the engineer I want to become.
